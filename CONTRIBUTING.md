# Before You Start

Get in touch with us to discuss your contribution: <mailto:support.curax@swisscom.com> 

# Contributing

All changes or additions that potentially benefit a significant portion of the user base are welcome. E.g. adding 
support for a new type of file source/sink, say S3 storage. 

# When to Fork Instead of Contributing

If your change is specific to your particular environment or usage scenario, or targets a niche product or protocol, 
then it is better to fork the project as we are unlikely to merge such a change into the main repository. E.g. 
adding an HTTP endpoint that exposes a proprietary telemetry data format.
